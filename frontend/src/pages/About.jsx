                  SHG Bazaar is a smart digital marketplace built to support and
                  promote the Self Help Groups (SHGs) of Goa. It provides a
                  simple way for local women entrepreneurs and community groups
                  to showcase, sell, and manage their handmade or homegrown
                  products online.

                  From Goan spices, traditional crafts, and homemade pickles to
                  eco-friendly products and textiles — SHG Bazaar connects these
                  talented producers directly with buyers, removing middlemen
                  and ensuring fair earnings.

                  The platform also helps SHGs track sales, and gain insights to
                  grow their businesses. By blending local craftsmanship with
                  modern technology, SHG Bazaar aims to make Goa’s rural and
                  community entrepreneurship stronger, more visible, and
                  self-reliant — empowering women and preserving Goa’s rich
                  cultural heritage, one product at a time.
